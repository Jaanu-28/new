A hackathon is an event where people, often tech-focused but not exclusively, come together to rapidly build and collaborate on a project, such as a working prototype or proof-of-concept, within a short timeframe like a weekend. The term is a combination of "hack" and "marathon". Participants can include programmers, designers, and product managers, who work in teams to solve problems, develop new ideas, learn new skills, and network with others in a collaborative and innovative atmosphere.
